## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that the best workflow is to start with mobile first, I confess I wasn't used to it and it was a little difficult for me, but as soon as I understood the concept the project started flowing.


### Continued development

I had a little difficulty using the <picture> tag, it is a box level, and it is taking up a lot of space on the card and I still don't understand how to improve it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images?hl=pt-br) - This site helped me better understand responsive images and how to make sure they don't leak through the card.
- [Example resource 2](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) - This just 21 day course taught me a lot of useful things and I definitely recommend it to anyone who is starting to develop responsiveness in their projects.
